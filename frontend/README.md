# Ingenious Front-End Test 

Front-End challenge for [Ingenious](https://www.ingenious.agency/) agency.

## Tech stack used ⚛

This app was developed using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and was bootstrapped with [CRA](https://create-react-app.dev/).

### Why? 🤔

- **React**: I 💘 React and I find myself the most comfortable using it
- **CRA**: CRA is the best way to quickly focus on developing the app itself instead of worrying about configuring a bundler among other tools
- **Chakra-UI**: I've been meaning to dive deeper into Chakra for some time and I thought this would be a good time to try it out. So far I loved it!

## Prerequisites 📝

Before setting up the app make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.

## Setting up the app 🛠

- **Backend**: open up a terminal, navigate to the `backend` folder and run `npm install`. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start` on this folder.
- **Frontend**: open up a terminal, navigate to the `frontend` folder and run `npm install`. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start` to start the development server and see the app on `http://localhost:3000`

## Roadmap (or things I wish I could've added but didn't have the time to do so) 🛤

- Integration tests using Testing-Library 🐙
- E2E tests using Cypress 🌲
